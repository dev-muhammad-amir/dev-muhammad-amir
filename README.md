### 🧠 About Me  
I am a **Software Developer** with hands-on experience in **web and mobile application development**.

I specialize in converting ideas and designs into **functional, scalable applications**, working across **PHP, Laravel, and modern frontend frameworks**. Alongside web development, I also build **cross-platform mobile apps using Flutter & Dart**.  

I have experience working with **REST APIs**, testing them using **Postman**, managing databases, and building custom modules for real-world use cases.  

With over **2+ years of learning, practice, and project-based experience**, I’ve worked with a wide range of technologies and tools while continuously improving my problem-solving and debugging skills.  

📖 I am always eager to **learn new technologies**, improve code quality, and grow as a professional developer.
